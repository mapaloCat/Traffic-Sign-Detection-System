# Traffic-Sign-Detection-System

This repo includes a Computer Vision project that aims to build a traffic sign detection algorithm. First, we train a “detector” CNN that determines whether a region proposal is a traffic sign and then a traffic sign classification net is used to obtain the actual class. The current implementation achieves 60% mAP (mean Average Precision) in a test set composed of 300 images. The execution time is 300 seconds.
