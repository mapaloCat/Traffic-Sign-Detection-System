# Traffic-Sign-Detection-System

This repo includes a Computer Vision project that aims at building a traffic sign detection algorithm. A “detector” CNN determines whether a region proposal is a traffic sign and it is followed by a traffic sign classification net to obtain the actual class of the detected traffic sign. The current implementation achieves 73.32% mAP (mean Average Precision) in a test set composed of 300 images. The execution time is 531 seconds.
